# Employee_Tracker

This employee trakcer is used to see the departments, roles, and employees of a small buisness. Creating this application was eye opening to the posibilitys of sql and having a good way to manage databases. I can see how this kind of functionality would be standard in most companys, and how it would greatly help keep things organized. It was fun learning about SQL and working with new syntax. In conclusion this was a good look into the organization and creation of tables/databases and I learned a great deal from it.
